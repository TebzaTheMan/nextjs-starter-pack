## Acknowlegments

I basically wanted to use this [nextjs-starter-pack](https://github.com/miami78/nextjs-starter-pack) but it didnt have typescript support.

So I made this starter-pack from following an awesome [tutorial](https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/nextjs-eslint-prettier-husky) written by [Jarrod Watts](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/).
